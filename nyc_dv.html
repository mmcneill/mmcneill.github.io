                    <p>The New York City Police Department (NYPD) responds to roughly 230,000 domestic incidents each year. At this scale, the ongoing protective services that NYPD's 400+ domestic violence prevention officers can offer survivors are a scarce resource <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/services/law-enforcement/domestic-violence.page">[source]</a>. To address this problem, the UChicago Crime Lab partnered with NYPD in 2016 to build a machine learning model to identify which individuals were most at risk for serious domestic violence revictimization. Using data on over ten years of police-reported domestic incidents—including survivor and officer narratives—we trained a model to make these predictions with a high degree of accuracy.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <div class="projectpage-content">
                <div class="projectpage-text">
                    <p>I joined this project in its early stages as soon as I was hired at the Crime Lab full-time in January 2017. As the sole <strong>data scientist</strong> on this project, I worked under the supervision of a Data Science Research Director on all technical stages of this project, from record linkage and data cleaning to final model building and evaluation. During the develpment stage of this project, I learned a lot about natural language processing (bag-of-words, embeddings, topic models) and more complex model-building techniques like stacking multiple base models to create a more accurate "meta-model." </p>
					<br>
					<p>Once the model entered the real-world testing phase, I was responsible for receiving monthly pulls of fresh data, putting that data through our record linkage and prediction pipelines, supplying an updated high-risk list to our partners, and tracking which individuals were referred when.</p>
