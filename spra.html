                    <p>The Service Provision Risk Assessment (SPRA) is a predictive model built on historic police records to identify individuals at high risk of gun violence. The UChicago Crime Lab originally built the SPRA as part of the <a href="readi.html" target="_blank">READI Chicago randomized control trial</a>, which enrolled men in programming through three referral pathways (community outreach organizations, jail staff, and the SPRA algorithm). You can read more about the SPRA on the Crime Lab website <a href="https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/projects/service-provision-risk-assessment-spra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <div class="projectpage-content">
                <div class="projectpage-text">
                    <p>By the time I joined the SPRA team, the tool had already been built and used to refer individuals to the READI study. I joined the team in the <strong>technical lead</strong> role, to oversee its maintenance and continued use in referring high-risk individuals to service providers on a quarterly basis. The code had become very time-consuming and difficult to run each quarter, and my main job was to provide a thorough code review and design and oversee a large refactoring effort to address issues with reproducibility, automation, code organization, and model performance. Following this refactoring effort, I oversaw the quarterly referral generation process by performing code review and other quality checks before referrals were shared with partners.</p>
