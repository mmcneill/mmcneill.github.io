                    <p>The Kewanee Life Skills Re-Entry Center is a prison facility in Illinois that attempts to lower reincarceration rates by investing heavily in the education, health access, and humane treatment of incarcerated individuals in the years leading up to their release.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Between late 2017 and early 2019, the UChicago Crime Lab and University of Illinois at Chicago partnered with the Illinois Department of Corrections to run a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate Kewaneeâ€™s impact. Evaluation of post-release outcomes like reincarceration, rearrest, and employment status is ongoing, as study members are gradually released from prison at the ends of their sentences. You can read more about the project on the Crime Lab website <a href="https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/projects/kewanee-lsrc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <div class="projectpage-content">
                <div class="projectpage-text">
                    <p>I joined the Crime Lab's Kewanee evaluation team in April 2024, after the study period had ended and short-term reincarceration outcomes had been analyzed. I serve as the <strong>technical lead</strong> of the project as we study Kewanee's longer term impact on reincarceration and begin to look at new outcomes like rearrest and post-release socioeconomic status.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This role involves coordinating with the project's PIs on research priorities, translating those priorities into discrete task for the analyst team, reviewing analysis for accuracy, and ensuring the analyst team meets grant reporting deadlines. Additionally, I am responsible for the overall health of the Kewanee evaluation codebase, including organizing code review, performing quality assurance, ensuring version control, and planning and overseeing refactoring efforts.</p>
