                <div class="projectpage-text">
                    <p>In 2017, New Jersey eliminated cash bail and introduced a pretrial risk assessment tool to help judges make more informed decisions about who should be released while awaiting trial. Following these reforms, New Jersey's jail population decreased by 30% without a major rise in violent crime. However, important questions about how the system could be improved further remained.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Between 2019 and 2024, the UChicago Crime Lab partnered with the New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) to identify and address potential limitations in the existing risk assessment tool, particularly around how domestic violence cases were evaluated. Our overarching goal was to make sure the tool’s design reflected the values behind the reforms—reducing unnecessary pretrial detention, maintaining public safety, and promoting fairness. The final deliverable of this partnership was a modified risk assessment scale designed to more accurately predict violent rearrests during a defendant's pretrial period.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <div class="projectpage-content">
                <div class="projectpage-text">
                    <p>I had a lot of different roles and responsibilities over the unique phases of this project. Initially, my role focused on <strong>data processing</strong> and <strong>exploratory analysis</strong>. Alongside three other data scientists, I helped build a large data-processing pipeline that transformed dozens of raw data files into a set of clean data files tailored to various levels of analysis. I eventually took on the role of <strong>technical lead</strong> for the data-processing aspect of the work, which involved organizing code review, performing quality assurance, ensuring version control, and planning and overseeing refactoring efforts. On the analysis side, I spent a lot of time investigating how the current risk assessment tool performed in domestic violence cases and organizing findings into easy-to-digest slide decks for weekly partner meetings.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Once we decided to build a new risk assessment scale, my work shifted toward <strong>building predictive models</strong> to estimate a defendant's risk of being arrested for a violent offense while on pretrial release. In this phase, I built both traditional black-box machine learning models and simple interger models designed with transparency and usability in mind. Through this work, I learned a lot about model fairness and the importance of tailoring evaluation metrics to match the model's real-world use case.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We are now in the process of writing up key learnings from the project into a series of academic papers. Stay tuned!</p>
