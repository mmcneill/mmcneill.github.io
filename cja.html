                    <p>The New York City Criminal Justice System (CJA) recently adopted a new pretrial release assessment tool to guide judges' decisions about whether to release, detain, or monitor a defendant as they await trial. This new tool, developed by my colleagues at the UChicago Crime Lab between 2017 and 2018, was designed to replace the existing 2003 pretrial assessment, which recommended detention at much higher rates than judges chose to do practice. The city phased in the new tool borough-by-borough over several weeks in the fall of 2019.</p>
                	<br>
                	<p>Analysis of historic data during tool development indicated that the new tool would provide dramatic improvements over the previous tool in accuracy, fairness, and alignment with judge behavior. However, a more rigorous evaluation is needed to understand the real impact that the new tool has had on judicial decision making in the five years since its adoption. The Crime Lab, again in partnership with CJA, is in the process of using quasi-experimental techniques to execute this more rigorous evaluation.</p>

                <div class="projectpage-text">
                    <p>I joined the NYC Release Assessment team in 2024 to help oversee very early-stage work using historical (non-study) data to stress test possible research designs. This work involved running power calculations and building predictive models to simulate how judges made decisions in the years leading up to the adoption of the new release assessment. Work is ongoing.</p>
